<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>


<p>The Cambridge University Boat Club has decided to spend &pound;8,000 in
improving the Cam. There is talk of making it into a river.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Says a writer in a contemporary, "Don't live in a houseboat during a
flood." And yet <span class="sc">Noah</span> always declared that he owed his life to having
done so.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The gentlemen who formed <span class="sc">M. Ribot's</span> Cabinet are objecting to being
described as "The One-Day Ministry." They were, they assert, in office
for some hours more than that.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The attack on M. <span class="sc">Ribot's</span> Ministry in the matter of the Three Years'
Service was led in the Chamber by three quite undistinguished
Socialists; and the contest was described succinctly by an unsympathetic
onlooker as "<i>Trois &acirc;nes</i> v. <i>Trois ans.</i>"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>By the way, M. <span class="sc">Viviani's</span> Finance Minister is, we see, <span class="sc">M. Noulens</span>. Is he,
we wonder, any relation of M. Noulens-Voulens?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> has commanded that the Colonial War Memorial to be erected in
Berlin shall take the form of an elephant. Presumably it is to be of
Parian marble in order to signify that some of the German colonies are a
bit like a white elephant.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A French squadron of eighteen vessels has lately been visiting Portland.
It was perhaps a little unfortunate that Admiral <span class="sc">Callaghan's</span> ship should
have been <i>The Iron Duke</i>&mdash;but no doubt our tactful officers explained
to their visitors that the vessel had been so named after a wealthy
iron-master who had been ennobled.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The report that an airship expedition is being prepared against the <span class="sc">Mad
Mullah</span> is said to have caused keen delight to the old gentleman, as he
has never seen an aeronautical display of any kind.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is now suggested that when Mr. <span class="sc">Hobhouse</span> took possession of H.M.S.
<i>Monarch</i>, he was labouring under the delusion that he was
Postmaster-Admiral as well as Postmaster-General.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The publication of <i>The Best of Lamb</i>, by Messrs. <span class="sc">Methuen</span>, reminds one
that a literary butcher once complained that <span class="sc">Lamb</span> had not been issued in
The Canterbury Poets.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Although Mr. <span class="sc">T. P. O'Connor</span> is severing his connection with <i>T. P.'s
Weekly</i> the name of the paper will not be changed. This sort of thing is
well calculated to confuse and unsettle the public. "T. P. or not T. P.?
that'll be the question."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is denied that the title of our newest magazine&mdash;<i>Blast</i>&mdash;was
suggested by Mr. <span class="sc">Bernard Shaw</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Old Spot Pigs," we are informed, are now being bred successfully once
more. It surprises us to hear this announced as a triumph. One would
have thought that in these days of beauty culture a clear complexion
would have been the desideratum.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"If," says a contemporary, "the middle-class girl were regularly
provided with a dowry, the matrimonial enthusiasm of young men would
probably be stimulated." We cannot imagine how people think of these
clever things.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Members of the Women's Social and Political Union are, says <i>The Daily
Mail</i>, boycotting West-End shopkeepers and stores not advertising in the
Militant organs. However, if the rest of the public will agree to
boycott such firms as do advertise in these organs the matter should
come all right.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A warning has been issued to pic-nic parties as to the danger from
adders, which are exceptionally numerous this year. They are apt to bite
if suddenly sat upon, and prudent persons are taking the precaution of
sitting on their plates.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"I shall never," writes a journalist in <i>The Express</i>, "forget the
shudder with which I saw a very well-known dramatist at a garden party
eating strawberries with his gloves on." We ourselves sometimes have
these sudden sensations, but, unlike the writer, are very prone to let
them slip out of our memory.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A dress-designer, we read, went mad one day last week in Paris and fired
a number of revolver shots at the police. To judge by many of the
creations one sees there must be quite an epidemic of mental deficiency
just now among designers of modes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Bags," we read in a lady's paper, "are going out of fashion." Men will,
however, continue to wear them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h2>HOW THE CHAMPIONSHIP WAS WON.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Story of 1918.</i>)</p>

<p>The last match of the season was between Kent and Somerset. Kent and
Surrey were at the top of the Championship table, with the following
percentages:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
Kent             87.51<br />
Surrey           87.23<br />
</p>

<p>Surrey had completed its programme. Thus all depended on the result of
this Kent-Somerset match. To become champions Kent had either to win
outright or to keep their percentage intact by the circumstance of both
sides not completing an innings.</p>

<p>Play was impossible on the first day owing to rain. On the second day
Somerset scored 157. Rain fell again and Kent were unable to commence
their innings till the afternoon of the third day. Obviously they had to
strain every nerve to accomplish two things: (1) to avoid getting out
and (2) to avoid scoring more than 157. At all hazards they must neither
win nor lose on the first innings. They could not win the match. There
was no time. And either a win or a loss on the first innings would lower
their percentage sufficiently to enable Surrey to go to the top. For in
the matter of averages it is better under certain conditions not to have
fought at all than to secure only a portion of the honours.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary afternoon's cricket. The Kent batsmen were very
careful, but two minutes before time there were 156 runs on the board
and the last two batsmen were at the wicket. If a wicket fell or a
couple of runs were scored Kent would lose the Championship. Strong men
shivered like leaves as ball after ball was steadily blocked by the
batsmen. Red-faced farmers wore their pencils to stumps in explaining
the appalling alternatives. Somerset, in the most sporting spirit, were
trying their hardest. A couple of deliberately-bowled wides would, of
course, have given Surrey the championship, but Somerset were playing
for the honour and glory of defeating Kent on the first innings.</p>

<p>The last two Kent men displayed wonderful nerve. The straight ones were
carefully stopped and every ball off the wicket was left alone. Needless
to say the softest long hop to leg would not have tempted them to hit.</p>

<p>When the bowler prepared to deliver the last ball of the day the very
trees round the ground seemed to stop whispering. It was a good length
ball, very fast and pitched slightly to the off. The batsman raised his
bat, expecting it to fly past the wicket. To his horror it nipped in.
Down came the bat in frantic haste. Heaven be praised! Just in time! The
bat just snicked the ball off. It missed the wicket by an eighth of an
inch and shot away to leg.</p>

<p>Then occurred one of those incidents that men boast of having witnessed,
one of those strange happenings in sport that are recounted to
generation after generation.</p>

<p>The ball had shot away to leg where there was no fieldsman. One of the
slips immediately made after it. The batsmen naturally did not run as
they did not wish to score. But suddenly it occurred to the striker that
it might reach the boundary, that the slip field might not be fast
enough to catch it up, and that, therefore, Kent would win on the first
innings and in so doing lose the championship. The idea flashed across
his mind almost immediately after he had hit the ball, and with a
promptness of action that was really beyond all admiration he dropped
his bat and ran like a madman in pursuit of the ball.</p>

<p>He easily outstripped the Somerset slip, who was rather a stout man, and
fled like a hare after the little red devil that was scorching fast in
search of the fatal four.</p>

<p>Men groaned in the agony of their excitement and women shrieked
hysterically.</p>

<p>On flew the gallant Kent batsman. Nearer and nearer he got to the ball.
He overtook it. He stopped it. Three inches from the boundary he fell on
it and hugged it to his chest. The match was a draw, a glorious draw!
Neither side had won or lost a point. It did not count in the
Championship table. Kent were Champions!</p>

<p>In the mad excitement of the moment no one thought of appealing on the
question of handling the ball or interfering with the field. Moreover
both the umpires had swooned and were being removed on shutters. The
result stood. The hero of the game was carried into the pavilion by two
music-hall agents and a reporter.</p>

<h2>MUSICAL NOTES.</h2>

<p>The remarkable and altogether epoch-making article in <i>The Times</i> of the
16th inst., on the stimulating effect of the bath on unmusical people,
has already borne notable fruit. Meetings of the Governing Bodies of all
the principal Musical Colleges and Academies were held on the following
day, at which it was unanimously determined, as one of the speakers put
it, to effect a closer synthesis of harmony and ablution. Sir <span class="sc">Hubert
Parry</span>, himself celebrated in his youth for his prowess in natation, has
offered to present the Royal College of Music with a magnificent
swimming bath; Mr. <span class="sc">Landon Ronald</span> has drafted a scheme for the erection
of a floating bath in the Thames for the convenience of the Guildhall
School, and Sir <span class="sc">Alexander Mackenzie</span> has offered the students of the
R.A.M. an annual prize for the best vocal composition in praise of
saponaceous abstergents.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Outside our musical academies the impetus given to musicians and
composers has been equally remarkable. Professor Banville de Quantock,
whose Oriental proclivities are well known, has at once embarked on a
gigantic choral symphony, to words of his own composition, in which the
whole process and procedure of the Turkish Bath is treated historically,
dramatically and realistically in seventeen movements. The title has not
yet been definitely fixed, but it will probably be known as the
<i>Symphonie Bath&eacute;tique</i>, to differentiate it from <span class="sc">Tschaikovsky's</span>
hackneyed work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Strauss</span> is reported by Mr. <span class="sc">Kalisch</span> to be engaged on a series of
<i>Spritzbadlieder</i> of extraordinary beauty and complexity, in which a
wonderful effect is produced by the employment in the orchestral
accompaniment of a new instrument called the Loofaphone, which produces
a curious hissing noise like that emitted by a groom when using the
currycomb. Another instrument to which prominence is assigned in the
score is called the Saponola and bears a resemblance to the spalacoid
sub-family of mandrils, which have the mandibular angles in close
proximity to the sockets of the lower cephalopods. The motto of the work
is "<i>Das ewig Seifige</i>."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We may further note, as one of the most valuable by-products of <i>The
Times</i> article, the announcement that an international Balneo-Musical
Congress will be shortly held in the Albert Hall, with a view to
discussing the best methods of promoting harmonic hygiene. The arena, we
understand, is to be converted into a vast demonstration-tank, in which
prominent composers, conductors and singers will appear. Miss <span class="sc">Carrie
Tubb</span> has kindly promised to preside. Amongst other items in the
programme we may mention an exhibition of under-water violin-playing by
Mr. Bamberger, and a game of symphonic water-polo between two teams of
Rhine maidens, captained by Herr <span class="sc">Nikisch</span> and Sir <span class="sc">Henry Wood</span>
respectively.</p>

<h2>IDEAL HOLIDAYS.</h2>


<p class="center"><span class="sc">Some Further Opinions.</span></p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Colonel Roosevelt</span>.</i>&mdash;There is no doubt whatever that the best holiday
ground is Brazil. There one can have excitement day and night. When one
is not escaping from a man-eating trout one is eluding a vampire bat. If
the time is slow one can always seek the Rapids. Next to Brazil I should
suggest the offices of the New River Company.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Hobhouse</span> (P.M.G.).</i>&mdash;I know very little of holidays, having to keep
my nose to St. Martin's-le-Grind-stone day and night, but I have thought
that, if I did take a week or so off, I should choose to spend it on the
Post Office yacht, roughing it.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Sir Edward Carson</span>.</i>&mdash;Such time as I can spare from Ulster and my daily
journey to and from London I should like to spend in explaining to
<span class="sc">Redmond</span> the duties of a War-lord.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Frank Tinney</span> (the famous American tragedian).</i>&mdash;Ordinary holidays
is just so much junk. Me and <span class="sc">Ernest</span> don't hold with them. Our idea of a
holiday is to go down town and hear jokes. The more jokes we hear the
bigger stock we have not to tell.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Winston Churchill</span>.</i>&mdash;I have often wondered if a busy administrator
might not get a very restful time by steadily refusing to fly.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Asquith</span>.</i>&mdash;This talk about the constant need for holidays seems to
me to be, if I may say so, one of the great illusions of the day. The
wise man surely is he who, seated in his chair of office, welcomes every
new complication and perplexity that the moments bring, and in labour
finds the true repose.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Mr. Masterman</span>.</i>&mdash;I am spending my own holiday just now very agreeably
in composing conundrums. This is my latest: "Why do I differ from my
trousers?" The answer is, "Because they don't want reseating."</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Lord Wimborne</span>.</i>&mdash;There is no place for a holiday like Meadowbrook.</p>

<hr />

<p>A set of 12 Elizabethan "Apostle" spoons were recently offered for sale
at Messrs. <span class="sc">Christie's</span>. Only one actual Apostle (Saint <span class="sc">Peter</span>) was
available, but excellent substitutes were provided in the persons of
<span class="sc">Alexander the Great</span>, <span class="sc">Charlemagne</span>, <span class="sc">Julius C&aelig;sar</span>, King <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, <span class="sc">Guy of

<h2>"WHEN OTHER LIPS ..."</h2>

<p>The most original feature of the Opera-Ballet, <i>Le Coq d'Or</i>, given last
week for the first time in England, was the arrangement by which the
actors were excused from singing, and the singers from acting. Chorus
and soloists, dressed uniformly, without distinction of sex, in a
nondescript maroon attire, were disposed on each side of the stage in a
couple of grand stands, from which they saw little or nothing of the
entertainment but enjoyed an uninterrupted view of the conductor. This
left the actors free to attend to the primary business of miming, which,
when it came to the distribution of applause, they clearly regarded as
the most important element in the show.</p>

<p>I look for great things from this new departure. It is rare enough for
an operatic performer to be capable of both singing and acting, or to be
alike beautiful to look on and to listen to. Once we have accepted the
convention by which an actor's lips are allowed to move in one part of
the stage while the sound comes from a totally different quarter, we may
go further and arrange for the singers to be put out of sight
altogether. He (and more particularly, she) might be posted behind some
sort of screen, diaphanous in respect of the vocalists' view of the
conductor, but opaque to the audience. When I think of some of the
rather antique and amorphous <i>prime donne</i> of German, Italian and French
opera, I know that any scheme which would render them invisible and
permit their acting parts to be played by young and gracious figures
would meet with my unqualified approval. It would be necessary, of
course, to consult them first (a task which I would not care to
undertake), and this division of labour would no doubt entail additional
expense, but I am convinced that the pure love of art for art's sake
which is inherent in the nature of all operatic stars and syndicates
would ultimately rise superior to considerations whether of pelf or
<i>amour propre</i>.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>
<div class="drama">
<div class="direction"><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The drawing-room of</i> John Staffurth, M.P. <i>Enter</i> Staffurth
<i>and</i> Barbara Cullen.</div>

<p><i>Staffurth.</i> Barbara, the doctors have given their verdict. My wife has
only two years to live.</p>

<p><i>Barbara.</i> John, but she looks so well! What's the matter with her?</p>

<p><i>Staffurth.</i> Well, it's a little difficult to explain. But without being
technical I may say that it is&mdash;er&mdash;not exactly appendicitis and
yet&mdash;er&mdash;not exactly mumps. Anyhow, it's always very fatal on the stage.</p>

<p><i>Barbara.</i> Two years! John, I'm not quite clear whether I'm <i>your</i>
relation or Diana's, or, in fact, what I'm doing in the house at all,
but as an old friend of <i>somebody's</i> may I give you a word of advice?</p>

<p><i>Staffurth</i> (<i>looking at his watch</i>). Certainly, but you must be quick.
I have to be back at the House in five seconds.</p>

<p><i>Barbara.</i> Then, John, give Diana a good time for those two years. Ask
her to recite sometimes, tell her about Welsh Disestablishment, at all
costs keep her amused.</p>

<p><i>Staffurth</i> (<i>amazed.</i>) My dear girl, do you realise I'm an Opposition
Member? The Government may spring a snap division on us at any moment.
(<i>Taking out his engagement book.</i>) Still, let me see what I can do. On
July 15th, 1916&mdash;&mdash; Oh no, that will be too late. November 25th,
1915&mdash;how's that? We might have an afternoon at Kew then if the Whips
don't want me. (<i>Looking at his watch.</i>) Well, I must be off. Don't let
Diana know she's ill.</p><br />

<div class="direction">[<i>Exit hastily.</i> <i>Enter</i> Diana Staffurth.</div>

<p><i>Diana.</i> I listened outside the door! Two years, and he won't even ask
me to recite to him! He doesn't love me.</p>

<p><i>Barbara.</i> He does, he does! But he's one of those men who never show it
till the Last Act.</p>

<p><i>Diana.</i> Well, I know somebody who doesn't mind showing it in the First
Act. (<i>Goes to telephone.</i>) Is that you, Captain Furness? I've just
learnt a new little piece.... Yes, don't be long.</p><br />
<div class="direction">[<i>She sits down to

<div class="direction"><i>Six months later.</i>

Captain Furness's <i>rooms</i>, 11.30 <i>p.m.</i>

<i>Enter</i> Furness <i>and</i> Diana.</div>

<p><i>Furness.</i> There, dear, now we can have a nice little supper together.
You do love me, don't you?</p>

<p><i>Diana.</i> I suppose so. I love talking to you on the telephone, anyway. I
can't think what we should have done in this play without the telephone.</p>

<p><i>Furness.</i> And you will come away with me to-morrow?</p>

<p><i>Diana.</i> Yes. (<i>To the audience</i>) Oh, I've only got eighteen months&mdash;&mdash;
(<i>To</i> Furness) Excuse me, Philip, this is a soliloquy; would you mind
not listening for a moment? (<i>He turns away and prepares the supper.</i>)
Oh, I've only got eighteen months more, and I want to <i>live!</i> I want to
talk on the telephone to people, and keep on changing my clothes, and
recite&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;<i>Philip!</i> You <i>don't</i> mean to say those are <i>marrons
glac&eacute;s</i> you've got there?</p>

<p><i>Furness.</i> Rather. Don't you like 'em?</p>

<p><i>Diana.</i> How dare you? You <i>know</i> the doctors won't let me touch them.</p>

<p><i>Furness</i>. My dear, you never told me what the doctors said to you. What
did they say?</p>

<p><i>Diana.</i> Well, anyhow, they said, "No more <i>marrons glac&eacute;s</i>."</p>

<p><i>Furness.</i> Really, Diana, how could I know?</p>

<p><i>Diana.</i> You ought to have guessed. You've insulted me and I'm going
home. And I shan't run away with you now. (<i>Picks up her cloak and goes
to the door.</i>) Er&mdash;if I <i>should</i> change my mind in the morning
I'll&mdash;er&mdash;telephone.</p><br />

<div class="direction"><i>Next morning.</i></div>

<p><i>Furness</i> (<i>at the telephone</i>). Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;no, Lorenzo&mdash;both ways. What?
Oh, I beg your pardon, I thought it was&mdash;is it you, Diana?... You <i>will</i>
come? Good.</p><br />

<div class="direction"><i>Enter</i> John Staffurth.</div>

<p><i>Staffurth.</i> Good morning. (<i>Looking at his watch.</i>) I want a little
talk with you if you aren't busy,</p>

<p><i>Furness.</i> Certainly. (<i>Handing box.</i>) Won't you begin a cigarette?</p>

<p><i>Staffurth</i> (<i>taking out case</i>). Thanks, I'll begin one of my own.
(<i>Does so.</i>) Now then. My sister-in-law&mdash;or cousin or&mdash;anyhow, my friend
Miss&mdash;or Mrs.&mdash;Cullen, Barbara Cullen, who&mdash;er&mdash;is still with us, told
me some days ago that you were about to elope with my wife. Is that so?</p>

<p><i>Furness.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Staffurth.</i> Yes. I ought to have spoken to you about it before, but I
have been very busy lately at the House. The Government is bringing in
its Bill for the Abolition of Telephones on the Stage, and it is
necessary for the full strength of the Opposition to be there. As I said
in my speech, any such Bill would, to take a case, ruin Mr. <span class="sc">Temple
Thurston's</span> new play at the Haymarket, and recent by-elections have shown
that the country was&mdash;&mdash; However, I need not bother you with that. The
point is that I have at last managed to get away to see you, and I want
to know what it is you propose to do.</p>

<p><i>Furness.</i> I'm going to send in my papers and take your wife away with
me.</p>

<p><i>Staffurth.</i> Ah! Then perhaps before you ruin your career I'd better
tell you what the doctors say about her, She is not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Furness</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). My dear chap, I know. She told me last night.
But it's all right, I don't much care for them myself.</p>

<p><i>Staffurth.</i>&mdash;&mdash; not likely to live for more than eighteen months.</p>

<p><i>Furness.</i> My God!</p>

<p><i>Staffurth.</i> That's what we all said several times when we heard it.
Well?</p>

<p><i>Furness.</i> Well, I mean, this wants thinking about. I had no&mdash;&mdash; My
career&mdash;only eighteen months&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Staffurth</i> (<i>breaking out at last</i>). You beastly egotist! You think of
nothing but your rotten career. You cur, you hound, you dog! You&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Furness</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). Now I warn you, Staffurth, I may only be about
half your size, but I shall have to thrash you severely if you talk like
that.</p>

<p><i>Staffurth.</i> You dog.</p>

<p><i>Furness</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). For the sake of your wife, go before I climb
up you and strike you.</p><br />

<h2>A LEGAL DOCUMENT.</h2>


<p>"There is," I said, "a guilty look about you. You are hanging round. At
this time of the morning you have usually retreated to your fastnesses.
Why has not the telephone claimed you? There is something on your mind."</p>

<p>"No," said the lady of the house airily; "I have a vacant mind."</p>

<p>"Where, then," I said, "is your loud laugh? I have not heard you shout
'Ha-ha,' or anything remotely resembling 'Ha-ha.' Something is weighing
upon you."</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"Yes at all," I said decisively. "You have something to confess."</p>

<p>"Confess!" she said scornfully. "What nonsense is this about confession?
We are not early-Victorians."</p>

<p>"Yes, we are. I insist upon it. I shall be busy with my writing. You
will come and kneel unperceived at my feet with an imploring look upon
your tear-stained face. I shall give a sudden start&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And," she went on enthusiastically, "I shall stretch out my hands to
you, and you will raise me tenderly from the floor, and I shall then
explain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That appearances were against you, but that Eugene is really your
brother by a first marriage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I shall then call for the smelling salts and swoon like this"&mdash;she
collapsed in an inanimate heap on the sofa&mdash;"and you will rise to your
full height&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I shall forgive you freely."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you will blame yourself for not having appreciated my
angelic nature, for having treated me as a mere toy, for having&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said," for having married you at all. But I shall forgive you
all the same, and I shall present you with the locket containing my
grandmother's miniature. Come on; let us start at once. I forgive you
from the bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>"All right," she said, "I accept your forgiveness. And now that we've
cleared the ground, you'll perhaps allow me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aha," I said, "then there <i>is</i> something after all?"</p>

<p>"There always is <i>something</i>," she said, "so perhaps you'll allow me to
ask you a question?"</p>

<p>"A question?" I said. "Ask me fifty. I don't promise to answer them. I'm
only human, you know, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely," she said, "this humility is exaggerated."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," I said, "I'll do my best, so fire away."</p>

<p>"What," she said, "does one do with a legal document?"</p>

<p>"Isn't this rather sudden?" I said. "'What does one do with a legal
document?' My dear, one does a thousand things. One buys land, or sells
it&mdash;which is much better. One gets separated, or, rather, two get
separated; one gets a legacy, generally quite inadequate; one executes a
mortgage, but you mustn't ask me who is the mortgagor and who is the
mortgagee, for, upon my sacred word of honour, I never can remember
which is which or who does what. One leaves one's money to one's beloved
wife by a legal document, or one cuts her off with a shilling and one's
second best bed, like <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>, you know. Really, there's nothing you
can't do with a legal document."</p>

<p>"How on earth," she said admiringly, "did you get to know all these
things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," I said. "One learns as one goes along. Men have to
know more or less about the law."</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said; "do you feel paralysed when you see a legal
document?"</p>

<p>"No, not now. They used to make me tremble, but I'm up to them now. I
understand their jargon."</p>

<p>"And frankly," she said, "I don't."</p>

<p>"But that doesn't matter," I said. "You've got a man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lucky me," she said.</p>

<p>"You've got a man to help you. That's what he's there for&mdash;to help you
with legal documents and to have his work interrupted and all his ideas
scattered. But, bless you, he doesn't mind. He knows his place."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "it's this way. A very dear friend of mine has taken a
house at the seaside, and they've sent her a document."</p>

<p>"A letting agreement," I said.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," she said; "and they want her to sign it; and they say
something about a counterpart which somebody else is to sign."</p>

<p>"That," I said, "is the usual way."</p>

<p>"What I want to know is, ought she to sign her document?"</p>

<p>"Is it the sort of house she wants?"</p>

<p>"The very house," she said. "She's been over it. Lots of rooms; nice
garden with tennis-lawn; splendid view of the sea; drainage in perfect
order; weekly rent a mere nothing. There's to be an inventory."</p>

<p>"Of course there is. It's always done. Does the document embody
everything she requires?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "everything; and they've thrown in two extra days for
nothing."</p>

<p>"In that case," I said, "her duty is clear. She must sign it."</p>

<p>"Do you advise that?"</p>

<p>"I do," I said, "most strongly."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," she said, "I'll do it at once," and before I could
interfere she had sat down at the writing-table, produced a document,
unfolded it and signed it.</p>

<p>"It is," she explained, "the agreement for letting Sandstone House,
Sandy Bay. They made it out in my name."</p>

<p>"But this," I said, seizing the paper, "is madness. It is not worth the
paper on which it is written."</p>

<p>"I did nothing," she said, "without your advice."</p>

<p>"I shall repudiate it," I said, "as having been obtained by fraud."</p>

<p>"Right-o," she said; "we leave for Sandy Bay on July 28th."</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span>)</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 15.</i>&mdash;In the mid seventies, when dear
<span class="sc">Johnny Toole</span> was at height of well-earned fame, he for a while played
three several parts on the same night. Bold advertisement announced
"Toole in Three Pieces." Being just the kind of joke that has the widest
run over the low level of mediocrity, it filled the gallery and upper
boxes.</p>

<p>To-night it was recalled with fresh application. House privileged to see
<span class="sc">Premier</span> in Three Pieces. For some weeks he has appeared at Question time
in dual character as Prime Minister and Secretary of State for War.
To-night takes on duties of absent <span class="sc">Chancellor of Duchy of Lancaster</span>. His
versatility as marvellous as his industry. In response to group of five
questions addressed to him "as representing the <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Duchy
of Lancaster</span>," bristles with minute information respecting number of
livings in gift of the Duchy in West Riding of Yorkshire, together with
amount of income of each benefice and nature of the security. Equally
master of intricate case of the calamity overshadowing the Pontefract
Cricket Club whose playing pitch has been damaged through subsidence
caused by underground workings.</p>

A GENEROUS RESTRAINT.<br />
<p>"I believe the Almighty has endowed us all with a certain amount of
brains; but we don't all use them." (Cheers).&mdash;<i>Mr. <span class="sc">Tickler</span> in the
debate on the Plural Voting Bill.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Situation raised nice questions as to responsibility of the underground
leaseholder and the prospect of compensation from coal royalties.
<span class="sc">Premier</span> as fully informed on these subjects as later he proved himself
when by way of Supplementary Question <span class="sc">Amery</span>, with pretty air of one
really in search of elementary information, inquired "In whose hands is
the government of Ireland at the present moment?" "In the hands of <span class="sc">His
Majesty's</span> Ministers," said <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 35%;">

</a><br /><br />
<p>"The one thing borne home to me was what a genius the
Irish people have for admiring each other."&mdash;<i>Mr. <span class="sc">Birrell</span>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>All very well for Duchy of Lancaster. Its affairs in strong capable
hands. But that does little to assuage grief of <span class="sc">Worthington-Evans</span>. For
months before the day when <span class="sc">Masterman</span>, greatly daring, exchanged safe
position of Secretary of Treasury for dizzy heights of Duchy of
Lancaster, <span class="sc">Worthington-Evans</span> was daily accustomed to pose him with
questions as to working of Insurance Act. In <span class="sc">Masterman's</span> enforced
absence from House <span class="sc">Wedgwood Benn</span> placed in charge of Insurance Act
Department. Does a difficult business exceedingly well. Has earned
approval from both sides of House. But <span class="sc">Worthington-Evans</span> is
inconsolable. His feelings find expression in couple of lines, learned
at his mother's knee, descriptive of anguish of blind boy parted from
his brother by ruthless hand of death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Oh, give my brother back to me;</p>
<p class="i2">I cannot play alone.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Visibly brightened up on eve of Ipswich election, which seemed to
promise return of the wanderer. As to-night he sits forlorn in corner
seat below Gangway to left of <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, gazing sadly at corner of
Treasury bench opposite (once amply filled by figure of former Secretary
of Treasury), <span class="sc">Stephen Gwynne</span>, seated next to him, gently nudges <span class="sc">Butcher</span>,
and with softened memories of <i>Peggotty</i> contemplating <i>Mrs. Gummidge</i>
in exceptionally low spirits, whispers, "He's thinking of the old 'un."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;After brief unsparkling debate Plural Voters Bill read
a third time. Hostile amendment moved from Front Opposition Bench
negatived by 320 votes against 242. Bill passed final stage without
division.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Home Rule fills the bill in both Houses. The Lords, back
from brief holiday, protest against delay in introducing Amending Bill.
In vigorous speech <span class="sc">Lansdowne</span> insists on early day being named. <span class="sc">Crewe</span>,
wringing his hands over unreasonable ways of some people, promises
Tuesday next. Adds that, if upon consideration of proposed amendments
noble lords should require longer interval before Second Reading of
parent measure than is provided by original fixture for 30th June, there
will be no objection to postponement.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether the hon. Member regards me as a
particularly frivolous person."</p>
<p class="author"><i>Lord <span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the Commons <span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span>, interposing in ordered business of Supply,
moves adjournment with view of calling attention to "growing danger
created in Ireland by existence of volunteer forces and failure of
Government to deal with situation." It is plurality of situation that
disturbs philosophical mind. As long as there was but one volunteer
force, its locality confined to Ulster, its purpose to defeat Home Rule
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
Bill, its commander-in-chief <span class="sc">Carson</span>, it was well. Nay more, it was
patriotic. But when Ulster's challenge, uttered by one hundred thousand
armed men, is answered by the South and West of Ireland with creation of
an army exceeding that number, whole aspect is altered. Now, as in the
time when "Measure for Measure" was written&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">That in the captain's but a choleric word</p>
<p class="i0">Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy,</p>
</div></div>


<p>Opposition, to a man, stand up to support <span class="sc">Lord Bob's</span> demand that matter
shall be discussed as one of urgent public importance.</p>

<p>In course of animated speech <span class="sc">Lord Bob</span> delighted House by equalling, if
not going one better than, the late Lord <span class="sc">Cross's</span> historic <i>jeu
d'esprit</i>.</p>

<p>"I hear an hon. member smile," said <span class="sc">Grand Cross</span> on a memorable occasion.</p>

<p>"I wish," said <span class="sc">Lord Bob</span> to-night, sternly regarding hilarious
Ministerialists, "those laughs could be photographed and shown
throughout the country."</p>

<p>Suggestion will doubtless not be lost on enterprising purveyors of
cinematograph shows.</p>

<p>There was another opportunity for the snap-shotter when, <span class="sc">Lord Bob</span>
lamenting the "ingrained frivolity of the Radicals in this grave
crisis," <span class="sc">Arthur Markham</span> interposed with Supplementary Question.</p>

<p>"What about Satan rebuking sin?" he asked.</p>

<p>Turning upon Member for Mansfield more in sorrow than in anger, <span class="sc">Lord Bob</span>
remarked: "I don't know whether the hon. Member regards me as a
particularly frivolous person." General and generous cheering approved
this implied disclaimer, and <span class="sc">Lord Bob</span> returned to consideration of "the
characteristic vice of the Radical Government&mdash;fear of losing their
places."</p>

<p>Tendency to introduce personal observations cropped up from time to time
through debate, which occupied greater part of sitting. <span class="sc">Carson</span> having
genially alluded to main body of Ministerialists as "lunatics," <span class="sc">Neil
Primrose</span>, turning upon the <span class="sc">Wistful Winston</span>, who hadn't been saying
anything, denounced him as "a human palimpsest."</p>

<p>Perhaps most touching case was that of <span class="sc">Byles</span> of Bradford. Having long
remained silent under undeserved contumely, he suddenly rose at
half-past ten and irrelevantly remarked, "I cannot understand how the
myth has grown up in this House that I am a blood-thirsty ruffian. Why,
Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, I would not kill a fly."</p>

<p>In view of proved inconvenience, not to say danger, of unrestrained
plague of flies, this protestation was received with mixed feelings.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;On division motion for adjournment of House negatived
by majority of 65. After this, the House, nothing if not logical,
forthwith adjourned.</p>

<p>POURING COLD WATER ON THE TROUBLED OIL.</p>
<p>(<span class="sc">Lord Charles Beresford</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Dillon</span>.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;The Irish Members, long quiescent, suddenly resumed former
habit of activity. House owes to <span class="sc">Amery</span> the pleasing variation. He cited
newspaper report of remarks recently made by Captain <span class="sc">Bellingham</span>,
aide-de-camp to the <span class="sc">Lord-lieutenant of Ireland</span>. Inspecting and
addressing body of National Volunteers, he exhorted them to ensure
triumph of Home Rule.</p>

<p>Was this a proper thing to do? Certainly not. <span class="sc">St. Augustine Birrell</span>,
answering <span class="sc">Amery's</span> question founded on incident, stated that when Lord
<span class="sc">Aberdeen</span> heard of matter he immediately called for explanation, and
Captain <span class="sc">Bellingham</span> frankly acknowledged error of judgment.</p>

<p>Irish Members recognised that in measure the error of judgment was
slight compared with <span class="sc">Amery's</span> in stirring up this dangerously attractive
pool. As everyone knows, and as House was promptly reminded, Colonel the
Marquis of <span class="sc">Londonderry</span> and Colonel Lord <span class="sc">Kilmorey</span>, aides-de-camp to <span class="sc">His
Majesty</span>, have on more than one occasion, when inspecting Ulster
Volunteers, urged them to stand indomitable in resistance to
establishment of Home Rule in their Northern Province. Irish Members
want to know whether these noble and gallant gentlemen have been called
upon to make explanation of their conduct similar to that peremptorily
exacted from Captain <span class="sc">Bellingham</span>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Premier</span> not to be drawn into delicate controversy. Pleaded lack of
notice of questions put to him. Irish Members will be delighted to
provide it. Shall hear more on the subject next week.</p>

President of Local Government Board, carries vote for his Department by
rattling majority of 127.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>


<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>All the world recognises Sir <span class="sc">Martin Conway</span> as a paramount peak-compeller
and explorer of resource, while superior persons, like this learned
clerk, know him as an effective <i>dilettante</i> in the realms of art. In
<i>The Sport of Collecting</i> (<span class="sc">Fisher Unwin</span>), with a general candour, but a
specific, canny (and of course rather tiresome and disappointing)
reticence as to prices, he gives us, in effect, a treatise on the craft
of curio-hunting, gaily illustrated by anecdotes of the bagging of
bronze cats in Egypt, Foppas and Giorgiones in Italian byways, Inca
jewellery in Peru, and heaven knows what and where beside. The authentic
method, apparently, is to mark down your quarry as you enter the
dealer's stockade, to pay no visible attention to it but bargain
furiously over some pretentious treasure which you don't in the least
want; later, admitting with regret your inability to afford the price,
to suggest that as a memento of your pleasant visit you might be
disposed to carry off that odd trifle in the corner over there; then,
bursting with hardly controlled excitement to see your priceless
primitive wrapped in brown paper and thrown into your cab, to drive to
your quarters, hug yourself ecstatically and boast to your friends and
fellow-conspirators about it. Shooting the driven tiger from the howdah
is quite evidently nothing to this royal sport of dealer-spoofing,
especially when the dealer knows a thing or two, as Sir <span class="sc">Martin</span> bravely
confesses he sometimes does. I wonder if this arch-collector, when he
discovered his best piece, Allington Castle (of which he discourses with
such pleasant and knowledgable enthusiasm), turned a contemptuous back
on the battlements and made a casual offer for the moat. A most
diverting book.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The name of <span class="sc">Madame Yoi Pawlowska</span> is new to me; but if her previous books
were anything like so good as <i>A Child Went Forth</i> (<span class="sc">Duckworth</span>) I am
heartily sorry to have missed them. There have been many books written
about childhood, and the end of them is not yet in sight; but I have
known none that so successfully attains the simplicity that should
belong to the subject. You probably identify the title as a quotation
from <span class="sc">Walt Whitman</span>, about the child that went forth every day, "and the
first object that he looked upon, that object he became." The child in
the present instance was one <i>Anna</i>, who went forth in the Hungarian
village where she was born, and saw and became a number of picturesque
and amusing things, all of which her narrator has quite obviously
herself recalled, and sat down in excellent fashion. I don't want you to
run away with the idea that <i>Anna</i> was a good or even a pleasant child.
Anything but that. The things she did and said furnished a more than
sufficient reason for her father to threaten again and again to send her
to school in England. The book ends with the realisation of this, which
had always been to <i>Anna</i> as a kind of shadowy horror in the background
of life. We are not told which particular English school was favoured
with her patronage, nor how she got on there. I was too interested in
her career not to be sorry for this omission; and that shall be my
personal tribute to her attractions.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>There are few persons who can write love stories with a surer and more
tender touch than <span class="sc">Katharine Tynan</span>. So I expect that many gentle souls
will share my pleasure in the fact that she has just put together a
volume of studies in this kind under the amiable title of <i>Lovers'
Meetings</i> (<span class="sc">Werner Laurie</span>). Personally my only complaint about them is
that in a short story lovers' meetings <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>mean the journey's end, and I
wished to spend a longer time in the society of many of the agreeable
characters of Mrs. <span class="sc">Hinkson's</span> studies. Take for example the first&mdash;and my
own favourite&mdash;of the series. There really isn't anything special in
it&mdash;and yet there is everything. What happened was that <i>Challoner</i>, a
confirmed bachelor, went to the Dublin quay to see off a friend on the
boat to Holyhead. The friend didn't turn up; but a young governess, with
whom <i>Challoner</i> had only the slightest previous acquaintance, was going
by the boat&mdash;so <i>Challoner</i> went with her, and they were married, and
lived happy ever after. You may think that this doesn't sound very
probable, and perhaps it doesn't; but it is so charmingly
told&mdash;<i>Challoner's</i> growing delight in the initial mistake that confuses
the pair as man and wife is so alluringly developed, and the whole
little episode of twenty pages has such a way with it as to take your
credulity a willing captive. This was my individual choice; but there
are fifteen others of various styles; some mild detective studies, and a
pathetic little ghost story that recalls to me one of <span class="sc">Kipling's</span> best.
Altogether an attractive collection, very far above many such that have
appeared lately.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Wilkinson Sherren</span>, in his new novel, <i>The Marriage Tie</i> (<span class="sc">Grant
Richards</span>), is very serious about the hypocrisies of the virtuous and the
injustice of our moral conventions. Other writers before him have been
serious about these things, and I do not know that Mr. <span class="sc">Sherren</span> has
anything very new to say. I must also confess to thinking that a sense
of humour would have assisted him greatly in his task. Nevertheless his
readers are certain to sympathise with his beautiful heroine in her
dismay at her unfortunate illegitimacy, and she is a good girl with a
great regard for the feelings of all her friends, even though she
expresses this regard a little stiffly. Mr. <span class="sc">Sherren</span> uses his background
well, and many of his scenes would be effective if only his characters
were debarred from dialogue. It would be, I am sure, beyond <i>Johanna's</i>
powers, were she limited to the deaf and dumb alphabet, to convey such a
speech as this: "I wish you to consent to your father's suggestions,
dear. By doing so you do not injure me, and you cheer his declining
days. I am sure your dear mother wishes it." Her methods would become
something much brusquer and more direct. I doubt if Mr. <span class="sc">Sherren</span> is at
his best in a novel. An essay on the confused issues of illegitimacy and
the punishment of the children for the sins of their fathers would show
him, I am convinced, at his ease; but dialogue and a beautiful heroine
are an embarrassment to him.</p>

<p>In a volume of tales and sketches entitled <i>The Mercy of the Lord</i>
(<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>) Mrs. <span class="sc">Flora Annie Steel</span> revives pleasant memories of her
Indian romances once beloved by me. In these new stories everybody
dies&mdash;if Europeans, with the latest slang upon their lips; if natives,
with a lusty invocation to Allah. Mrs. <span class="sc">Steel</span> does not believe in letting
the reader know what she is about, and there is generally something up
her sleeve. Each story has its own little puzzle, and, if the puzzles
are not always solved by the end of the tale, one can make all kinds of
pleasant conjectures as to what really did happen, and Mrs. <span class="sc">Steel's</span>
mysterious hints and shrugs and fingers on the lip do beyond question
assist her atmosphere. I like best of the stories "Salt of the Earth," a
most moving tale, beautifully told. Always Mrs. <span class="sc">Steel</span> is interesting,
and I hope these sketches are only little preludes to another of her
thrilling romances.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>If Mr. <span class="sc">Bertram Smith's</span> <i>Caravan Days</i> (<span class="sc">Nisbet</span>) has not made me eager to
take to the road at once, the reason is that he seems to delight in
things that I most cordially detest. For instance, he likes cooking and
he is "very fond of rain." With such tastes he has more facilities for
enjoying himself than are offered to most of us, and I find myself
wondering whether life in a caravan, always supposing that he was not
there to do the cooking and admire the rain, would be quite as much fun
as he would have us believe. I am confident that when next he goes upon
his travels the majority of his friends will be anxious to share the
attractions of his <i>Sieglinda</i>, that caravan of caravans, but I doubt if
they will be ordering <i>Sieglindas</i> for themselves. Meanwhile, so human
has Mr. <span class="sc">Bertram Smith</span> made his <i>Sieglinda</i> that I can well imagine her
sulking in her retirement because she wants to see Argyll, the only
county in Scotland she has not yet sampled.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>If you are a musical genius yourself and want to do a young composer a
good turn, I implore you not to get his opera produced under the
pretence that it is yours and wait until it has been received
enthusiastically before you announce whose work it is. For that is what
<i>Jess Levellier</i> did, and "Miss <span class="sc">Louise Mack</span>" tells us what a deal of
trouble was brought about by this impulsive action. There are several
love stories in <i>The Music Makers</i> (<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>). There is the affair
of <i>Jess</i> and there is the affair of <i>Jess's</i> father; and in regard to
the second of these I would say that I am a little tired of adventurous
women who are first attracted by dollars and then find that they are
head over ears in love with the man himself. But in case you are not
adequately intrigued by either of these romances, I can also tell you
that <i>Sir William</i> (big and burly) and <i>Trixie Harrison</i>, though
married, gave considerable cause for anxiety before with "outstretched
hands she went tottering towards him." Even the most jaded novel-readers
will suffer thrills and surprises from <i>The Music Makers</i>, and
occasionally, perhaps, they will wonder whether coincidence's long arm
has not been stretched to the point of dislocation. However that may be,
the book is breezy and its author is lavish of her material.
Parsimonious writers would have made half-a-dozen novels out of the
stuff of Mrs. <span class="sc">Creed's</span> book.</p>

<h2>MORE MUNITIONS OF PEACE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>An Episode in the Camp of the Nationalist Volunteers.</i>)</p>

<p>Several further months had elapsed in the history of the scheme for the
"better government of Ireland." The Home Rule Bill had been read for the
third time in the Inferior Chamber, but, apart from this conciliatory
action, no effective attempt had been made to avert the horrors of Civil
War.</p>

<p>Meanwhile two coups had been planned, of which the one failed and the
other succeeded. And during the arrangements for the first coup (for it
got no further than the preparatory stage&mdash;and even this was denied) it
was revealed that British officers were not very greatly inclined to
shoot down their fellow-countrymen for the sake of the <i>beaux jeux</i> of a
political party. And for this the politicians of that party, selecting
the worst name they could think of, described these officers as
politicians. And the cry of "The Army <i>v.</i> the People," started by a
Labour Member (who wore a large hat), and supported by the <span class="sc">First Lord of
the Admiralty</span> (who wore a small one), was raised very high and then
dropped, as likely to prove inexpedient.</p>

<p>But the other coup (which succeeded) was a very clever feat of
gun-running on the part of the Ulster Volunteers. And, the law having
been broken, the Government, as its guardian, determined to take no
punitive measures&mdash;an attitude that was repellent both to Sir <span class="sc">William
Byles</span> and to Mr. <span class="sc">Neil Primrose</span>.</p>

<p>And now there grew up in each political party a body of rebellion. For
on the Liberal side there were those, notorious at other seasons for
their advocacy of peace at whatever charges, who gave out that there
were worse things than Civil War, and one of the worse things was the
stultification of their own projects, or, as they put it, of the Will of
the People; though they showed no strong anxiety to discover, by the
usual tests, what the Will of the People might actually be in the
matter.</p>

<p>And on the Unionist side there were those who said that they would do
nothing to provoke Civil War, but that, since it took two sides to
conduct a Civil or any other kind of War, and the British Army was
apparently not available, there was no fear of Civil War, and they (the
Unionist Party) could well afford to stiffen themselves about the lips.</p>

<p>And all this tended to embarrass the labours (if any) of those leaders
who were still supposed to be holding communion together for the
furtherance of a compromise.</p>

<p>Now, among the Ulster Volunteers, though perfect sobriety was exhorted
and maintained, it was excusably felt that it would be a pity if so fine
a force should have been raised and armed at such expense and sacrifice
and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span> have no chance of showing what it could do. And this feeling
evoked sympathy in the breasts of the Irish of the South and West; and
they said to them of Ulster, "Rather than see your army wasted we will
ourselves raise one for you to shoot at." And this they did, in part for
sheer joy of the chance of a fight, and in part for admiration of the
sportsmanship of a people that had defied a British Government. And
though some joined the new Volunteers for love of Home Rule, and with
the object of offering themselves as substitutes for the British Army,
yet the promoters were content to allege, vaguely and inoffensively,
that their object was just the protection of Irish liberty, whatever
that might be taken to mean. And, being Irish, no exact logic was asked
of them.</p>

<p>But at first Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span>, as a supporter of the law, and scandalised by
its breach in Ulster, declined to approve this illegal development,
which for the rest he regarded as negligible. But later, when it had
grown too large to be ignored, he generously consented to overlook its
illegality and to place it under official patronage. But his offer was
received in a spirit of very regrettable independence. On reflection,
however, this attitude was exchanged for one of sullen submission.</p>

<p>Now a private army is a dangerous thing when you know what it is for;
but it is a very dangerous thing when you don't. And there were
cynics&mdash;not too frivolous&mdash;who held that the best course for the
Government would be to withdraw from Ireland for the time being and
leave Ulster and the Rest to come to an agreement of their own, either
with or without a bloody prelude. And there were other critics&mdash;not much
more frivolous&mdash;who replied that, if we walked out of Ireland and left
Ulster and the Rest to come to terms, they might get to understand one
another to such good purpose that we should never have the opportunity
of walking in again.</p>

<p>And the Government's only consolation lay in the thought that the Rest
of Ireland lacked the munitions of war owing to the vigilant precautions
taken to prevent the importation of arms into Ulster.</p>

<hr />

<p>A thrill of emotion rippled over the tented plain. Into the camp of the
Nationalist Volunteers had dashed a motor-car which was taken to be the
forerunner of a great consignment of smuggled arms, for it contained a
bulky wooden case with the label "Munitions of Peace" pasted upon its
fa&ccedil;ade&mdash;a superscription that might well have been designed to mislead
the wariest of coastguards and patrols. Its sole convoy was an old
gentleman&mdash;evidently selected for the part, for by his air of simple
benevolence you would have judged him the last man in the world to be
suspected of nefarious practices.</p>

<p>A cry of bitter disappointment broke out on the discovery that the
"munitions" consisted of nothing but books. But the uproar died down as
the old gentleman was seen to assume the attitude of an orator. His
words were at first received in courteous silence; then with sympathetic
approval; finally with deafening applause.</p>

<p>"Nationalist Volunteers!" he said: "I come from performing a similar
mission of camaraderie among the hosts of Ulster. I am no partisan. I am
like a certain philanthropist of whom I have heard who purveyed sherbet
to the rival camps of the Sultan of <span class="sc">Morocco</span> and the Pretender. I trust
that my fate may not be his, for he was the sole person killed in one of
the noisiest battles ever fought in the environs of Fez.</p>

<p>"This tome, identical with the rest of my munitions of peace, embodies
(for I made the contents myself, and so ought to know) the highest
wisdom mingled with the purest material for mirth. Its contemporaneous
perusal in both camps should encourage a common ideal of humour and so
promote mutual respect and affection.</p>

<p>"I would go even further and express the hope that here may be found a
spirit of genial tolerance which, if assimilated by all parties, will
infallibly lead to a solution of the Irish Question without the
inconvenience of bloodshed. Gentlemen, permit me!" And thereupon he
presented to the admiring gaze of his audience <i>Mr. Punch's</i></p>
